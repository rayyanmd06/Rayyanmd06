## 🚀 Featured project (click to open)
### ❤️ 1. Fairness-Aware ML — Cardiovascular Risk  
**TL;DR:** Built an end-to-end machine-learning pipeline for cardiovascular disease risk prediction with **84.9% accuracy**, while mitigating **gender bias** using **Fairlearn**. The project demonstrates reproducible data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and interpretability via a **Streamlit dashboard**.

**Highlights:**  
- 🎯 `84.9% accuracy` on test set  
- ⚖️ Applied *Fairlearn Exponentiated Gradient* for **Demographic Parity** fairness mitigation  
- 📊 Interactive **Streamlit app** for clinicians to visualize predictions and fairness metrics  
- 🧠 Tools: Python · scikit-learn · Pandas · Fairlearn · Streamlit


**Repo:** https://github.com/rayyanmd06/cvd-risk-prediction-using-fairnessmodel  


### 2. **Real-Time Driver Sleepiness Detection**
- **What:** Simulator-driven pipeline (Unity3D) + low-latency inference path.  
- **Why it matters:** Improves road safety with fast, reliable alerts.  
- **Highlights:** >90% detection accuracy • <500 ms alarm latency • Python-Unity socket integration.

**Repo:** https://github.com/rayyanmd06/Driver-sleepiness-detection/blob/main/README.md


### 3. 🎙️ AI Interview Partner – Real-Time Voice Interview Coach  
** Built a **voice-first AI interview agent** that conducts realistic mock interviews, listens to answers via mic, and gives **structured, actionable feedback** at the end.

**Highlights:**  
- 🧠 Uses **LLM-powered interviewer logic** to ask role-specific questions (e.g. *“Sales Developer”*, *“Python Developer”*).  
- 🎤 **Real-time voice interface** with continuous listening + push-to-talk style UX.  
- 🗣️ Text-to-Speech + Speech-to-Text pipeline for fully conversational interviews in the browser.  
- 📋 Generates detailed **INTERVIEW FEEDBACK** (strengths, weaknesses, overall score, and improvement plan).  
- 💻 Tech: **FastAPI · Web Speech API · gTTS · Python · HTML/CSS/JS** with a glassmorphism UI over a video background.
