# 👋 Hiii, I’m **Mohammed Rayyan**
**AI Engineer-in-training • BSc CSBS (Jain University ’26)**  
I build production-ready ML systems with a focus on fairness and low-latency inference.  
🔭 Currently polishing demos & deploying a fairness-aware CVD model and a real-time driver sleepiness detector.

### 1. Fairness-Aware ML — Cardiovascular Risk❤️ 

**TL;DR:** End-to-end pipeline for CVD risk prediction — strong accuracy while reducing gender bias using Fairlearn. Includes notebooks, model artifacts, and a Streamlit demo.  
**Highlights:** `84.9% accuracy` · Fairlearn (Exponentiated Gradient + Demographic Parity) · Streamlit dashboard
**Repo:** https://github.com/rayyanmd06/cvd-risk-prediction-using-fairnessmodel  


### 2. **Real-Time Driver Sleepiness Detection**
- **What:** Simulator-driven pipeline (Unity3D) + low-latency inference path.  
- **Why it matters:** Improves road safety with fast, reliable alerts.  
- **Highlights:** >90% detection accuracy • <500 ms alarm latency • Python-Unity socket integration.
- **Repo:**(https://github.com/rayyanmd06/Driver-sleepiness-detection/blob/main/README.md)
